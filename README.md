## **Projects & Contributions**  

### 🔥 Recent Highlights  
- 💵 **[_SpendWise_](https://github.com/FTDS-assignment-bay/p2-final-project-ftds-036-rmt-group-001.git)**  
  *As a Data Scientist in this Project, I built five initial Machine Learning Models using: KNN, SVM, DT, RF, and AdaBoosting.  
  after Model Evaluation, I choose AdaBoosing and did the Hyperparameter Tuning to further increse the performance of the Model*
  
- 🌐 **[ForestFirePredict](https://github.com/septyoa/ForestFirePredict)**  
  *I built this Machine learning Model using Computer Vision to identify forest fire images*  

- 📊 **[LaptopPircePredict](https://github.com/septyoa/LaptopPricePredict)**  
  *This Machine Learning Model was built to help costumer find out the budget they need to prepare to buy a laptop by desired specs*
